To-Do List
==========
 - Nothing at this time.


Configuration
=============

All configuration is managed through the sad.ini (or alternative specified
on command-line).  If any are omitted or left blank, the specified default
is used unless otherwise noted.

Sections [sadup], [CustomRulesActive] and [CustomRulesStable] are not used
by sad.  See the documentation for sadup for more information.

SECTION:		[sad]

HostName		Specifies the hostname the daemon should listen on.  For
			security reasons, it defaults to localhost.

Port			Specifies the port to use.  The default is 7941.

MailRoot		If specified, all paths in commands are ignored and only
			files in this location will be checked.  If omitted, paths
			will be checked. While this shouldn't necessarily be a
			security concern, it's better to be safe and specify the
			root.

Debug		Defaults to 0 (off).  This is only helpful if running via
			command-line instead of as a service and shows the actual
			SpamAssassin processing of mail.

LogDir		Defaults to the console (no logging).  Otherwise, all
			logging will be written to the path specified.

LogGMT		Defaults to 0 (no).  Determines whether local time or GMT
			time is used in logging.

LogConnects	Defaults to 0 (no).  Determines whether connect/disconnect
			messages are logged.  Otherwise only the commands are
			logged.

LogClientNames	Defaults to 0 (no).  In a production environment, the
			daemon should only be connected to from the same machine,
			therefore the client hostname and IP will always be the
			same.  Not logging could save a bit of space and time.

ShowBanner	Defaults to 0 (no).  If set to yes, a banner showing the
			program name, version and ready to accept message will be
			displayed to the client on connect.

Rewrite		Defaults to 0 (no).  If set to yes, the email will be
			rewritten Spam Assassin style.

MaxCheckSize	Defaults to 0.  If set to non-zero, the email will be
			skipped if its size is greater than this (in bytes).

SECTION:		[SpamAssassin]

DefRules		No default - the location of SpamAssassin's default rules
			must be specified.

SiteRules		No default - the location of SpamAssassin's local/site
			rules must be specified.
