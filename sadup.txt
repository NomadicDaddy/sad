Configuration
=============

All configuration is managed through the sad.ini (or alternative specified
on command-line).  If any are omitted or left blank, the specified default
is used unless otherwise noted.

The [SpamAssassin] section is primarily used for sad itself.  The options
not specifically relevant to sadup have been omitted.

SECTION:		[SpamAssassin]

SiteRules		No default - the location of SpamAssassin's local/site
			rules must be specified.

SECTION:		[sadup]

Reload		Defaults to 0 (no).  Reload sad on new/updated rulesets.

CheckInterval	Defaults to 12 hours.  Determines the time between checking for
			ruleset updates.

LogDir		Defaults to the console (no logging).  Otherwise, all
			logging will be written to the path specified.

LogGMT		Defaults to 0 (no).  Determines whether local time or GMT
			time is used in logging.

ServerIdentity	No default.  Just a name used in the notification email for
			identification purposes.

NotifyAdmin	Defaults to 0 (no).  Determines whether an administrative notice
			of updated rules should be sent.
